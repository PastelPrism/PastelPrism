- 👋 Hi, I’m @PastelPrism (or Amy, if one prefers that )
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, yet there is so little time.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting comfortable with coding (and walking) again, after life (a car) happened 😄
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... not so fast, first recreate everything by myself. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Well, usually the best way is by flying through my window. You will definately have my attention then! 
      Otherwise try the normal way, which is amy-van-leeuwen@proton.me in case you really want to give that feedback. 
      Which could be helpful. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: giraffes are very poor swimmers, although it might not be fun, it is a fact.
- ✨ I got challenged! Fun! To complete every fullstack course out there, whilst being in recovery for the next six months. 
     And this here, will probably be the result of all that. 
- ⚡ I also got goals: Besides catching every Pokémon there is (which is rather difficult without the app, but I'm always up for a challenge)
                       it is also a goal to get back to work, on a bike! (or by car, depends on you know, the distance and all)  


  Now I wish you a very good day (or night), Bye! 👋
