_This is a 'Far from finished' README_ ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PastelPrism (or Amy, if one prefers that )
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, yet there is so little time. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Well, usually the best way is by flying through my window. You will definately have my attention then! 
      Otherwise try the normal way, which is amy-van-leeuwen@proton.me in case you really want to give that feedback. 
      Which could be helpful. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: giraffes are very poor swimmers, although it might not be fun, it is a fact.
- âœ¨ I got challenged! Fun! To complete every fullstack course out there, whilst being in recovery for the next six months. 
     And this here, will probably be the result of all that. 
- âš¡ I also got goals: Besides catching every PokÃ©mon there is (which is rather difficult without the app, but I'm always up for a challenge)
                       it is also a goal to get back to work, on a bike! (or by car, depends on you know, the distance and all)  


  Now I wish you a very good day (or night), Bye! ðŸ‘‹
