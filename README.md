# Hi there, I'm Amy! 👋

_This README is, like most README's you'll find on this profile, under construction!_ 😄

## 🌟 About Me

**Currently:** On a mission to do _every_ front-end or full-stack development course that's out there. Is that possible you might ask? No... but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun challenge.  
And I happen to like fun. 
 

## 🎯 Current Challenge

Why I am currently on this mission is because I've been challenged to not only do all these courses, but to also do them with an extra assignment. - and I absolutely like those as well! And this profile will document that journey, because journeys need to be documented.


## 💻 What You'll Find Here

This profile showcases a challenged learning journey through various study repositories and some client projects (created with fellow students or adapted from coursework). 

### 🎓 Learning Platforms I'm currently trying to finish things on:
- **FreeCodeCamp** 
- **Codecademy** 
- **Udemy** 
- **The Odin Project** 
- **Scrimba** 
- **Treehouse** 
- **SoloLearn** 
- **Mimo** 
- **CodeSignal** 
- **Skillshare**

**Focus Areas:** Frontend & Full-Stack development paths, whichever comes first!

## 👀 I'm Interested In...
So many things, yet there's so little time! Currently getting happy from:
- Modern web development frameworks
- UI/UX design principles  
- AI coding
- The magic of making websites prettier (well, to my vision that is)
